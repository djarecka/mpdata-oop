The following sequence of commands should result in reproduction
of all tests and plots discussed in the paper.

The commands were tested to work with the following software versions
(Debian/Ubuntu package names given in parenthesis):

    - Blitz++ 0.10      http://sf.net/projects/blitz/        (libblitz0-dev)
    - GCC 4.8           http://gcc.gnu.org/        (gcc-snapshot or gcc-4.8)
    - PyPy 1.9          http://pypy.org/                              (pypy)
    - NumPy 1.7         http://numpy.org/                     (python-numpy)
    - CPython 2.7       http://python.org/                          (python)
    - Clang 3.2         http://clang.llvm.org/                       (clang) 
    - Boost 1.49        http://boost.org/                     (libboost-dev)
    - CMake 2.8         http://cmake.org/                            (cmake)
    - perf 3.2          http://perf.wiki.kernel.org/           (linux-tools)
    - time 1.7          http://gnu.org/software/time/                 (time)
    - gnuplot 4.6       http://gnuplot.info/                       (gnuplot)
    - gnuplot-iostream  http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/
                                                          (gnuplot-iostream)

Known strict version requirements:
    - Blitz++ >= 0.10
    - GCC >= 4.8
    - CMake != 2.8.10 (see note below)

To compile the C++ and Fortran programs, please start with running the cmake 
optionally pointing it to any custom compiler or library locations: 

    $ cmake . \ 
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/lib/gcc-snapshot/bin/g++ \
      -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/lib/gcc-snapshot/bin/gfortran 

Successful CMake run should generate Makefile files to be used with GNU make.
A single "make" call should suffice (and produce, among other binaries:
./cpp/inout-cpp, ./cpp/test-cpp-gnucxx and ./for/test-for):

    $ make

In order to reproduce the tests comparing GCC and Clang, a second CMake run 
is needed (beware this will clear all custom CMake settings - if the first 
CMake run needed any additional options, these have to be repeated again):

    $ cmake . \ 
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/lib/gcc-snapshot/bin/gfortran 

(CMake 2.8.10 has a bug causing it to enter an infinite loop here, 
erasing CMakeFiles directory helps) 

A second make run will compile ./cpp/test-cpp-nongnu with clang

    $ make

To check correctness of all five set-ups (GCC, Clang, gfortran, 
CPython and PyPy), one may run sanity tests:

    $ cd tests/sanity
    $ make test
    $ cd ../../

In order to run the timing tests discussed in the paper, it is needed 
first to generate the test data by calling:

    $ ./testgen.sh

CMake has to be called again to add the new files to its list of tests:

    $ cmake .

Finally, to start the timing tests, type "make test" in tests/timing:

    $ cd tests/timing
    $ make test

Plots presented in the paper (as well as several other plots showing 
cache usage statistics) can be generated with gnuplot by typing:

    $ gnuplot plot.gpi
